The repository contains data, visualization plots, and reproduction scripts for the paper
"DaFy: Data-Centric Fortran Portability".

The repository consists of three main components: `data` contains results generated and presented
in the paper, `analysis` includes all scripts used to produce plots included in the paper,
and `microbenchmarks` and `cloudsc` contain software needed to reproduce the results obtained in the paper.


### Software

We use the dace-centric programming framework [DaCe](https://github.com/spcl/dace)

It includes:
(i) an abstract describing the main contributions of the article and the role of the computational artifact(s) in these contributions.
(ii) the abstract may include a software architecture or data models and its description to help the readers understand the computational artifact(s) and
(iii) a clear description on to what extent the computational artifact(s) contribute(s) to the reproducibility of the experiments in the article.

### Reproducibility

#### Experiments

#### Paper results

(ii) an estimation of the execution time to execute the experiment workflow.
(iii) a complete description of the expected results and an evaluation of them, and most importantly.
